,,,,1321,"Per his own words, he was supposed to be a “transition president” and serve only one term. If the Dem’s had had an actual primary, I think the election would have turned out very differently.

Edit: Since people are asking, here are the relevant quotes:

> “I view myself as a transition candidate,” Mr. Biden said during an online fund-raiser last week, likening his would-be presidential appointments to an athletic team stocking its roster with promising talent: “You got to get more people on the bench that are ready to go in — ‘Put me in coach, I’m ready to play.’ Well, there’s a lot of people that are ready to play, women and men.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-pick.html

> Former Vice President Joe Biden’s top advisers and prominent Democrats outside the Biden campaign have recently revived a long-running debate whether Biden should publicly pledge to serve only one term, with Biden himself signaling to aides that he would serve only a single term.

https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129

> “Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Biden said at a rally in Detroit, one of his last pre-lockdown campaign appearances of the 2020 Democratic primaries. It was early March, and he was flanked by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and a pair of his former rivals, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker—all members of what Biden would call “an entire generation of leaders” and “the future of this country.”

I can't read the article because it's paywalled, but I wouldn't be surprised if we're getting this headline out of context. I have to admit that I might die on my way to work, don't I? Don't you?

Kennedy died in office at age 46. Shit happens. FDR -- who had poliomyelitis -- worked right up until he died at 63 (which was the average life expectancy of civilian men in 1945.)

I only acquiesced to Biden stepping down on the basis that Harris had a better chance of beating Trump, because progressives and moderates wouldn't vote for a possibly senile old man. Well, progressives didn't turn out for Harris, and moderates voted for a most-definitely senile old man.

What’s the cost we pay for reassurance? We lost Roe, we haven’t reformed policing. The internet isn’t regulated like a utility (still, despite being a government utility to begin with), and we still don’t fucking have clean drinking water in major cities.
